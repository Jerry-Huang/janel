# janel

This project is a spin-off of the great [Janel](https://sourceforge.net/projects/janel/) by Timothy Kil.
Since version 3.4.0 of Janel I'm contributing code that enhances Janel and I always have passed my enhancements
to Timothy. Some of my enhancements and fixes of version 4.0.4 sadly got lost on the way to the official version.
So I decided to create this GitHub project that makes it a lot easier for me to bring by enhancements and fixes
to the public. 

I'll continue to push all my contributions to Timothy so he can integrate them into the official Janel distribution
(and I really hope that Timothy will integrate them because I'm no friend of fragmentation and I have no interest
in two competing Janel distributions).

# Java Native Executable / Launcher
Janel is a free, Open Source Java native executable and launcher for Windows. Launch your Java application just like other
Windows executables. Within the configuration file set the location of the JVM, any of the Java system properties such as
classpath, and more. A choice of non-console and console applications is available. The process name is whatever you choose
for your .exe file. New for Janel 4.x is the ability to use the Janel executable as a Windows service.
